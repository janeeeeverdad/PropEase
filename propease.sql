Basic Information\nProject Title: Career Compass: Personalized Career Guidance System for Laguna Senior High\nSchool (LSHS) Students through the use of NLP, Machine Learning and Data Analytics\nTopic: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Senior High School Students, Career\nGuidance System\nProponent: JAREEN PIA B. ANDRES, EDRIAN B. FLORES, ANDREL JOHN M.\nPANTANOZA\nB. Technical Description\nThe current status of employment in today\'s date has been shown as a competitive global\neconomy, it is paramount for students to make well-informed decisions regarding their career\npaths, especially with the growing opportunities for overseas education. While studying abroad\noffers numerous avenues for personal and professional growth, it can also pose challenges,\nparticularly for students grappling with uncertainty about their future endeavors.\nThis is where the significance of career guidance becomes evident. Career guidance plays a\npivotal role in assisting students in comprehending their individual strengths, weaknesses, and\ninterests, thereby providing them with a clearer understanding of the diverse career avenues\navailable. Through tailored guidance, students gain insights into various industries, job roles,\nand the requisite skills and qualifications essential for success in their chosen fields (Bhargava,\nP. 2023, March 01) .\nCurrently, a mandatory exam called the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) is\nbeing implemented for grade 9 students nationwide. The NCAE is an aptitude test designed to\nprovide information for self-assessment, career awareness, and guidance for high school\nstudents as they prepare for their post-secondary courses or apply for scholarships (DEPED\nBohol, 2013).\nThe primary objective of the NCAE is to bridge the gap between student skillsets and the\nrequirements of the labor market. By identifying aptitudes in distinct areas, students can be\nguided toward appropriate Senior High School (SHS) tracks and prospective careers that align\nwith the Philippines\' workforce enhancement efforts (DEPED Bohol, 2013).\nAs per DepEdTambayan.com, the results of the NCAE are purely suggestive, without any\nprescribed cut-off score. The generated results regarding the Senior High School Track are not\nmandatory for students to participate in.\nAdditionally, the importance of thorough career guidance extends to:\nProviding students with the opportunity to explore/navigate on their own:\nOffering students the chance to explore and navigate on their own is crucial. While\nguidance is essential, it\'s important not to impose restrictions, as each individual is unique in\nvarious aspects. Allowing them to explore independently ensures a personalized approach\ntailored to their specific needs and interests, as well as their strength, weakness and other\ncharacteristics.\nTracking career trajectories:\nWith numerous options and opportunities available, it can be challenging to monitor one\'s\ncareer path. Similar to regular health check-ups, maintaining consistent communication with a\ncareer counselor at predetermined intervals can assist students in confirming they are\nadvancing in the correct career path.\nAddressing the influence of misinformation:\nToday, one of the major hurdles students encounter is parental influence on their career\ndecisions. While parents often aim to guide their children towards what they perceive as the\nideal career, their notions may not always align with the child\'s aspirations or the evolving job\nmarket. Moreover, with careers constantly evolving and numerous options available, it\'s crucial\nfor both students and parents to stay informed about changing trends to make informed\ndecisions.\nCorrecting career expectations:\nWe must recognize that careers have their limitations and boundaries. It\'s essential to assess\nthe scope of a career path and explore potential avenues available presently and in the future.\nBefore committing to a university course, students should consider how it aligns with their\nprofessional aspirations. While we cannot predict all potential changes, we can evaluate the\nviability of a profession based on current trends and insights into the industry\'s landscape.\nMitigating, if not eliminating, uncertainty:\nOne of the biggest issues for students in their college years is their uncertainty with their\ncurrent course, especially at times when they are facing hardships. They tend to consider\nshifting to another course or in worst case scenarios, they choose to drop out as they lack\nmotivation since their judgment is clouded by uncertainty.\nStatement of the Problem:\nThe Career Compass project seeks to address the prevalent gap in senior high school\nstudents\' understanding of suitable curriculum choices in alignment with their future career\naspirations. Despite the importance of this decision, students often lack access to personalized\nguidance, leading to confusion and uncertainty regarding their educational paths.\n1. How can the Career Compass system effectively utilize machine learning algorithms to\nclassify and analyze students\' skills, and knowledge per particular subjects, thereby\nproviding personalized career recommendations?\n2. What data preprocessing techniques can be implemented within the Career Compass\nsystem to optimize the accuracy and reliability of the training dataset, ensuring that it\nadequately represents students\' diverse backgrounds and career aspirations and\nalignment?\n3. In what ways can data analytics, and NLP be integrated into the Career Compass system\nto forecast/show the outline for College courses and future job trends and industry\ndemands, enabling timely and relevant career recommendations for senior high school\nstudents?\n4. Will the Career Compass system have access to existing datasets for training and\nvalidation, or will it need to collect and curate new datasets to ensure the effectiveness\nand reliability of its career guidance functionalities?\n5. How accurately and reliably can the Career Compass system leverage the combination\nof machine learning and nlp to provide tailored career guidance to senior high school\nstudents, and what metrics will be utilized to evaluate its performance and effectiveness\nin addressing students\' needs and aspirations?\nObjectives: General and Specific General Objective:\nThe main objective of this study is to design and develop a robust machine learning model that\nutilizes algorithms to classify students\' interests, skills, and preferences, non-technical skills\n(strength and weaknesses) along with suitable course alignment starting from their SHS up till\nCollege courses and Job target interest.\nSpecifically, it aims to:\n1. Gather relevant datasets, including students’ academic performance, and industry\nbased data, to train and validate the machine learning model for accurate career\nalignment suggestions.\n● Student based Dataset: Will be provided by Laguna Senior High School\n● Industry based Dataset: Online resources and references will be utilized.\n2. Implement data preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality and reliability of the\ntraining dataset, ensuring it adequately represents students\' diverse backgrounds and\ncareer aspirations.\n● Natural Language Processing Techniques:\n-Data Cleaning\n-Feature Selection and Categorization\n-Encoding Categorical Variables\n-Data Normalization\n-Exploratory Data Analysis\n-Validation\n3. Integrate data analytics tools to analyze job market trends and industry demands,\nenabling the system to provide timely and relevant career recommendations.\n● Data Analysis Techniques\n● Job Market Analysis\n● Industry Demand Analysis\n4. Design and develop a user-friendly web-based system that serves as a platform for\nsenior high school students to access personalized career guidance based on their\nindividual profiles and preferences.\n● Development of a web-based system to enable easier access for students or\ninstitutes. As suggested through a preliminary interview with an expert in the\nfield of education.\nHow did others solve the problem?\n1. NCAE proposed solutions (Teacherph.com, 2016):\nThe NCAE offers a standardized assessment that evaluates students\' aptitudes and\ninterests across various occupational areas. This approach provides a more objective\nevaluation compared to solely relying on student preferences or anecdotal observations.\nData-driven recommendations are provided based on the NCAE results, offering students\nguidance on suitable Senior High School (SHS) tracks that align with their assessed\nstrengths and interests.\nBy combining the NCAE results with guidance counselor support, students are\nempowered to make more informed decisions about their future education and career\npaths.\n2. Implementation of OJT on Select Colleges in Quezon City (Hebron, D., September\n2020)\nThe advantages of On-the-Job Training (OJT) for students serve as a crucial bridge\nbetween academic learning and professional readiness. OJT accelerates skill\ndevelopment, instills confidence, and fosters a sense of belonging within the\nworkplace. By immersing students in real-world scenarios, OJT equips them with\nindustry-specific knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, OJT enhances growth\nopportunities by providing tailored feedback and preparing students to handle\nunforeseen challenges effectively. Despite some challenges encountered during OJT,\nsuch as inadequate equipment or labor-intensive tasks, the overall experience\nempowers students to develop essential skills, adapt to change, and formulate realistic\ncareer plans\nOther Related Study (data gathering and machine learning methods)\n1. Guidance interview with a careers’ adviser (University of Kent)\nThe data gathering is characterized by its impartial, confidential, challenging, and\nsupportive nature. Careers advisers provide objective exploration without bias, maintain\nconfidentiality, and challenge your goals to ensure thorough consideration. Additionally,\nthe process is supportive, offering a safe environment for discussion as privacy is\nrespected. It\'s essential to recognize that career choice is a continuous process, and the\ninterview serves as a starting point, requiring further research and action plan updates.\n2. The National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) gathers datasets from examinees\nthrough standardized scores and percentile ranks.\nStandard scores are calculated with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. The\nhighest scores typically range in the 700s, while the lowest scores are found in the 300s.\nThese scores provide a standardized measure of each examinee\'s performance relative to\nthe mean and standard deviation of the entire population.\nPercentile ranks indicate the test taker\'s position among all examinees. For example, if\nan examinee scores at percentile rank 99+, it signifies that they scored higher than 99%\nof the other examinees. This percentile rank offers insight into an individual\'s relative\nstanding within the entire group of test takers.From then on, they use the gathered data\nto analyze and suggest SHS track based on students’ criterias.\n3. Based on José-García et al. (2022), career guidance systems like C3-IoC provide self-\nassessment tools, searchable occupation databases, and decision support models. These\nsystems advance by matching student competencies with job requirements and aiding in\nidentifying aligned positions.\nHowever, effective assessment extends beyond technical skills to include non-technical\nskills, interests, and personality traits. Modern systems, like MBTI and O*NET Interest\nProfiler offers diverse approaches, while CAPA suggests college major clusters based on\ninterests.\nTo ensure accuracy, systems rely on databases like ONET and ESCO. Yet, they may lack\nspecificity, especially in industries like UK IT. C3-IoC addresses this with\ncomplementary datasets, merging research-based taxonomies with real-time job market\ndata for a comprehensive understanding of skill requirements.\nPatents\n1. In their study titled \"C3-IoC: A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills\nusing Machine Learning and Network Visualization\" (December 2022), José-García et\nal. introduce a novel approach to personalized career exploration and skill assessment,\nparticularly in the IT sector. The research aims to bridge the gap in existing career\nguidance systems by developing the C3-IoC system, which provides users with insights\ninto both technical and non-technical skills required for various IT job roles. This\nsystem is built upon three main modules: a knowledge base of skills and job roles\ncurated from recent UK IT job vacancies, a user skill profiling module allowing for\nskill input and refinement, and a personalized job role matching and visualization\nmodule enabling users to explore potential career paths through network visualizations.\nThrough text mining techniques and analysis of job titles, the study constructs a\ncomprehensive database of technical skills and common job roles within the IT\nindustry. Users can then input their skills and refine their profiles using visualizations\nsuch as radar charts, facilitating a personalized assessment of their strengths and\nweaknesses. The system further aids users in exploring job roles through network\nvisualizations, allowing them to visualize their placement in the IT job role space based\non their skill profiles. Overall, the C3-IoC system serves as a valuable tool for\nempowering students to make informed decisions about their career paths within the\ndynamic landscape of the IT job market.\nTheoretical Framework:\nFigure 1. C3-IoC: A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills using Machine\nLearning and Network Visualisation (José-García, A., et al. (2023). C3-IoC: Career\nGuidance System. Journal Name, 33, 1092–1119.)\nThe current C3-IoC system aims to offer personalized career exploration and facilitate users\'\nunderstanding of both technical and non-technical skills essential for IT sector careers. While\nprimarily focusing on IT, the system also includes information on various job roles to cater to\nusers outside this sector.\nThe system architecture comprises three main modules: a knowledge base of skills and job\nroles, a user skill profiling module, and a personalized job role matching and visualization\nmodule. The user journey involves three stages: initial extraction of skills through a CV parser\nand questionnaire, refinement of skill profiles, and exploration of job roles through network\nvisualization.\nThis framework emphasizes the system\'s objective of providing tailored career guidance and\nenhancing users\' comprehension of requisite skills, ensuring a comprehensive approach to\ncareer exploration within and beyond the IT domain.\nHow do you intend to solve the problem?\nTo address the educational and career planning challenges faced by senior high school\nstudents at Laguna Senior High School (LSHS), the proponent plans the development and\nimplementation of \"Career Compass,\" a personalized career guidance system powered by\nmachine learning, NLP and data analytics.\nCareer Compass aims to provide tailored assistance to students by offering a user-friendly\ninterface designed to meet their specific needs. It will incorporate informative modules covering\nvarious aspects of career planning and educational pathways, ensuring students have access to\nrelevant information.\nFurthermore, it will prioritize assessing students’ capability/knowledge per subject then\ncourse alignment as a key feature. It will offer practical tools to help students identify the best\ncollege course to take based on their interests and academic performance. Through informative\nmodules and interactive features, the system will guide students in understanding the alignment\nbetween their chosen SHS strand and potential college curricula. By integrating course\nalignment functionalities, Career Compass aims to provide students with the necessary guidance\nto make informed decisions about their educational pathways. This emphasis on course\nalignment will ensure that students are equipped with the knowledge and resources to navigate\ntheir educational and career journeys effectively. The pathway does not just stop upon college\ncourse alignment, it would also show the specifics when it comes to certain jobs/industries along\nwith up to date income range.\nIn short…\nThe criteria for alignment suggestions will be based on students’ grade per subject, interests\n(added feature), then career aspirations.\nIn return, students will receive visualizations regarding the alignment between their interests and\npotential career pathways. This includes recommendations for the best associated college\ncurricula, applicable or potential job industries, and up-to-date salary ranges for these industries.\nThey will also be able to see the relevance of their results per area and identify the exact areas\nthat lack nourishment if they have decided to pursue a certain path/job. Additionally, the system\nwill show specific areas students should navigate during their early age to help them become\nmore familiar with the background and fundamentals.\nFor example, if a student wants to be a game developer, even during their SHS, they may already\nexplore various programming languages and certain fundamentals to help them achieve their\ngoal.\nScope:\nDesign and development of a machine learning-based career guidance system aimed at\nassisting senior high school students in selecting appropriate educational and career paths\naligned with their capability in terms of their graded knowledge per subject.\nUtilization of student-based data provided by the school for training the model, complemented\nby industry data sourced from online resources to align career suggestions with current job\nmarket demands.\nImplementation of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to analyze\nstudents\' academic performance, along with job market trends, for personalized career\nrecommendations.\nIn terms of system development, a user-friendly web-based application for students and\neducational institutions, enabling easy access to personalized guidance and\nrecommendations.\nLimitations\nThe system\'s effectiveness may be limited by the availability and quality of student-based data\nprovided by the school. Insufficient or inaccurate data can impact the accuracy of career\nrecommendations.\nReliance on industry data sourced from online resources introduces the risk of outdated or\ninaccurate information. Changes in job market trends may not be promptly reflected in the\nsystem\'s recommendations.\nThe system\'s ability to generalize recommendations to diverse student profiles and career\npreferences may be a challenge. Customizing recommendations for individual students with\nunique interests and goals requires sophisticated algorithms and a comprehensive\nunderstanding of user preferences.\nHandling sensitive student data and ensuring privacy and security measures in data storage,\nprocessing, and transmission are critical concerns that need to be addressed to comply with\ndata protection regulations and maintain user trust.\nIn terms of the industry-based data, the rapidly changing nature of job markets and the\nemergence of new career paths could affect the long-term accuracy and relevance of the\nsystem\'s recommendations.\nTarget users / Beneficiaries:(Describe each Beneficiary)\nStudents:\nThe Career Compass system will be a benefit for the students by providing personalized career\nguidance and course recommendations, helping them make informed decisions about their\neducational and career pathways.\nParents:\nParents will benefit from increased confidence in their children\'s future prospects, as well as\naccess to resources based on facts and support for guiding their children through the career\nexploration process.\nSchools:\nEducational institutions can enhance student engagement and retention by integrating the Career\nCompass system into their existing platforms, providing tailored career guidance and course\nrecommendations to students based on their interests and aspirations. This implementation\nsupports more informed curriculum planning, aligning educational offerings with students\'\ncareer goals and fostering a more supportive learning environment.\nCompanies:\nEmployers will benefit from a more skilled and prepared workforce, leading to improved\nrecruitment outcomes and reduced skill gaps in the job market.\nSignificance of study:\nThe Career Compass project is significant due to its help targeted to senior high school\nstudents at Laguna Senior High School in the Philippines in terms of planning for their future\ncareers. This system uses technology to give students personalized advice on which courses to\ntake and which careers might suit them best. It\'s important as it helps students make better\nchoices about their education and future jobs. Additionally, it supports schools by providing\nthem with a helpful tool to assist their students in career planning. Ultimately, Career Compass\naims to assist students to make informed decisions and achieve success in their academic and\nprofessional lives in the long run.\nGap Analysis\nTITLE DESCRIPTION SCOPE/TECHNOLOGY YEAR\nTECHNOLOGY: C3 IoC\nC3-IoC: A Career The C3-IoC stands as a pioneering solution C3-IoC career assessment 2022\nGuidance System for in the realm of career guidance systems, system specific for the IT\nAssessing Student specifically tailored to empower students in sector.\nSkills using Machine navigating the complex landscape of the\nLearning and Information Technology (IT) sector.

Firstly, CNNs\nnetworks\nexhibited remarkable proficiency in\nandclassactivation\nidentifying the barks of 42 distinct tree\nmapping\nspecies, achieving accuracy rates\nsurpassing 90%. Notably, comparative\nanalysis between the two employed CNN\nmodels, namely VGG-16andEfficientNet,\nrevealed onlymarginalvariancesinoverall\naccuracy. The study identified diagnostic\nkeys for each species, correlating them\nwith distinct bark features such asblisters,\nstripes, lenticels of various shapes, and\ncrevices. Interestingly, the two CNN\nmodels demonstrated discrepancies in the\nquality of diagnostic features, with the\nolder model presenting more general yet\nwell-fitting patterns,whilethenewer,more\nintricate model indicatedlocalizedpatterns\nless pertinent to bark identification.\nFurthermore, CNNs showcased the\ncapability to predict untrained species\nwithin the correct genus and family by\napproximately 41.98% and 48.67%,\nrespectively.

Basic Information\nProject Title: Career Compass: Personalized Career Guidance System for Laguna Senior High\nSchool (LSHS) Students through the use of NLP, Machine Learning and Data Analytics\nTopic: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Senior High School Students, Career\nGuidance System\nProponent: JAREEN PIA B. ANDRES, EDRIAN B. FLORES, ANDREL JOHN M.\nPANTANOZA\nB. Technical Description\nThe current status of employment in today\'s date has been shown as a competitive global\neconomy, it is paramount for students to make well-informed decisions regarding their career\npaths, especially with the growing opportunities for overseas education. While studying abroad\noffers numerous avenues for personal and professional growth, it can also pose challenges,\nparticularly for students grappling with uncertainty about their future endeavors.\nThis is where the significance of career guidance becomes evident. Career guidance plays a\npivotal role in assisting students in comprehending their individual strengths, weaknesses, and\ninterests, thereby providing them with a clearer understanding of the diverse career avenues\navailable. Through tailored guidance, students gain insights into various industries, job roles,\nand the requisite skills and qualifications essential for success in their chosen fields (Bhargava,\nP. 2023, March 01) .\nCurrently, a mandatory exam called the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) is\nbeing implemented for grade 9 students nationwide. The NCAE is an aptitude test designed to\nprovide information for self-assessment, career awareness, and guidance for high school\nstudents as they prepare for their post-secondary courses or apply for scholarships (DEPED\nBohol, 2013).\nThe primary objective of the NCAE is to bridge the gap between student skillsets and the\nrequirements of the labor market. By identifying aptitudes in distinct areas, students can be\nguided toward appropriate Senior High School (SHS) tracks and prospective careers that align\nwith the Philippines\' workforce enhancement efforts (DEPED Bohol, 2013).\nAs per DepEdTambayan.com, the results of the NCAE are purely suggestive, without any\nprescribed cut-off score. The generated results regarding the Senior High School Track are not\nmandatory for students to participate in.\nAdditionally, the importance of thorough career guidance extends to:\nProviding students with the opportunity to explore/navigate on their own:\nOffering students the chance to explore and navigate on their own is crucial. While\nguidance is essential, it\'s important not to impose restrictions, as each individual is unique in\nvarious aspects. Allowing them to explore independently ensures a personalized approach\ntailored to their specific needs and interests, as well as their strength, weakness and other\ncharacteristics.\nTracking career trajectories:\nWith numerous options and opportunities available, it can be challenging to monitor one\'s\ncareer path. Similar to regular health check-ups, maintaining consistent communication with a\ncareer counselor at predetermined intervals can assist students in confirming they are\nadvancing in the correct career path.\nAddressing the influence of misinformation:\nToday, one of the major hurdles students encounter is parental influence on their career\ndecisions. While parents often aim to guide their children towards what they perceive as the\nideal career, their notions may not always align with the child\'s aspirations or the evolving job\nmarket. Moreover, with careers constantly evolving and numerous options available, it\'s crucial\nfor both students and parents to stay informed about changing trends to make informed\ndecisions.\nCorrecting career expectations:\nWe must recognize that careers have their limitations and boundaries. It\'s essential to assess\nthe scope of a career path and explore potential avenues available presently and in the future.\nBefore committing to a university course, students should consider how it aligns with their\nprofessional aspirations. While we cannot predict all potential changes, we can evaluate the\nviability of a profession based on current trends and insights into the industry\'s landscape.\nMitigating, if not eliminating, uncertainty:\nOne of the biggest issues for students in their college years is their uncertainty with their\ncurrent course, especially at times when they are facing hardships. They tend to consider\nshifting to another course or in worst case scenarios, they choose to drop out as they lack\nmotivation since their judgment is clouded by uncertainty.\nStatement of the Problem:\nThe Career Compass project seeks to address the prevalent gap in senior high school\nstudents\' understanding of suitable curriculum choices in alignment with their future career\naspirations. Despite the importance of this decision, students often lack access to personalized\nguidance, leading to confusion and uncertainty regarding their educational paths.\n1. How can the Career Compass system effectively utilize machine learning algorithms to\nclassify and analyze students\' skills, and knowledge per particular subjects, thereby\nproviding personalized career recommendations?\n2. What data preprocessing techniques can be implemented within the Career Compass\nsystem to optimize the accuracy and reliability of the training dataset, ensuring that it\nadequately represents students\' diverse backgrounds and career aspirations and\nalignment?\n3. In what ways can data analytics, and NLP be integrated into the Career Compass system\nto forecast/show the outline for College courses and future job trends and industry\ndemands, enabling timely and relevant career recommendations for senior high school\nstudents?\n4. Will the Career Compass system have access to existing datasets for training and\nvalidation, or will it need to collect and curate new datasets to ensure the effectiveness\nand reliability of its career guidance functionalities?\n5. How accurately and reliably can the Career Compass system leverage the combination\nof machine learning and nlp to provide tailored career guidance to senior high school\nstudents, and what metrics will be utilized to evaluate its performance and effectiveness\nin addressing students\' needs and aspirations?\nObjectives: General and Specific General Objective:\nThe main objective of this study is to design and develop a robust machine learning model that\nutilizes algorithms to classify students\' interests, skills, and preferences, non-technical skills\n(strength and weaknesses) along with suitable course alignment starting from their SHS up till\nCollege courses and Job target interest.\nSpecifically, it aims to:\n1. Gather relevant datasets, including students’ academic performance, and industry\nbased data, to train and validate the machine learning model for accurate career\nalignment suggestions.\n● Student based Dataset: Will be provided by Laguna Senior High School\n● Industry based Dataset: Online resources and references will be utilized.\n2. Implement data preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality and reliability of the\ntraining dataset, ensuring it adequately represents students\' diverse backgrounds and\ncareer aspirations.\n● Natural Language Processing Techniques:\n-Data Cleaning\n-Feature Selection and Categorization\n-Encoding Categorical Variables\n-Data Normalization\n-Exploratory Data Analysis\n-Validation\n3. Integrate data analytics tools to analyze job market trends and industry demands,\nenabling the system to provide timely and relevant career recommendations.\n● Data Analysis Techniques\n● Job Market Analysis\n● Industry Demand Analysis\n4. Design and develop a user-friendly web-based system that serves as a platform for\nsenior high school students to access personalized career guidance based on their\nindividual profiles and preferences.\n● Development of a web-based system to enable easier access for students or\ninstitutes. As suggested through a preliminary interview with an expert in the\nfield of education.\nHow did others solve the problem?\n1. NCAE proposed solutions (Teacherph.com, 2016):\nThe NCAE offers a standardized assessment that evaluates students\' aptitudes and\ninterests across various occupational areas. This approach provides a more objective\nevaluation compared to solely relying on student preferences or anecdotal observations.\nData-driven recommendations are provided based on the NCAE results, offering students\nguidance on suitable Senior High School (SHS) tracks that align with their assessed\nstrengths and interests.\nBy combining the NCAE results with guidance counselor support, students are\nempowered to make more informed decisions about their future education and career\npaths.\n2. Implementation of OJT on Select Colleges in Quezon City (Hebron, D., September\n2020)\nThe advantages of On-the-Job Training (OJT) for students serve as a crucial bridge\nbetween academic learning and professional readiness. OJT accelerates skill\ndevelopment, instills confidence, and fosters a sense of belonging within the\nworkplace. By immersing students in real-world scenarios, OJT equips them with\nindustry-specific knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, OJT enhances growth\nopportunities by providing tailored feedback and preparing students to handle\nunforeseen challenges effectively. Despite some challenges encountered during OJT,\nsuch as inadequate equipment or labor-intensive tasks, the overall experience\nempowers students to develop essential skills, adapt to change, and formulate realistic\ncareer plans\nOther Related Study (data gathering and machine learning methods)\n1. Guidance interview with a careers’ adviser (University of Kent)\nThe data gathering is characterized by its impartial, confidential, challenging, and\nsupportive nature. Careers advisers provide objective exploration without bias, maintain\nconfidentiality, and challenge your goals to ensure thorough consideration. Additionally,\nthe process is supportive, offering a safe environment for discussion as privacy is\nrespected. It\'s essential to recognize that career choice is a continuous process, and the\ninterview serves as a starting point, requiring further research and action plan updates.\n2. The National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) gathers datasets from examinees\nthrough standardized scores and percentile ranks.\nStandard scores are calculated with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. The\nhighest scores typically range in the 700s, while the lowest scores are found in the 300s.\nThese scores provide a standardized measure of each examinee\'s performance relative to\nthe mean and standard deviation of the entire population.\nPercentile ranks indicate the test taker\'s position among all examinees. For example, if\nan examinee scores at percentile rank 99+, it signifies that they scored higher than 99%\nof the other examinees. This percentile rank offers insight into an individual\'s relative\nstanding within the entire group of test takers.From then on, they use the gathered data\nto analyze and suggest SHS track based on students’ criterias.\n3. Based on José-García et al. (2022), career guidance systems like C3-IoC provide self-\nassessment tools, searchable occupation databases, and decision support models. These\nsystems advance by matching student competencies with job requirements and aiding in\nidentifying aligned positions.\nHowever, effective assessment extends beyond technical skills to include non-technical\nskills, interests, and personality traits. Modern systems, like MBTI and O*NET Interest\nProfiler offers diverse approaches, while CAPA suggests college major clusters based on\ninterests.\nTo ensure accuracy, systems rely on databases like ONET and ESCO. Yet, they may lack\nspecificity, especially in industries like UK IT. C3-IoC addresses this with\ncomplementary datasets, merging research-based taxonomies with real-time job market\ndata for a comprehensive understanding of skill requirements.\nPatents\n1. In their study titled \"C3-IoC: A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills\nusing Machine Learning and Network Visualization\" (December 2022), José-García et\nal. introduce a novel approach to personalized career exploration and skill assessment,\nparticularly in the IT sector. The research aims to bridge the gap in existing career\nguidance systems by developing the C3-IoC system, which provides users with insights\ninto both technical and non-technical skills required for various IT job roles. This\nsystem is built upon three main modules: a knowledge base of skills and job roles\ncurated from recent UK IT job vacancies, a user skill profiling module allowing for\nskill input and refinement, and a personalized job role matching and visualization\nmodule enabling users to explore potential career paths through network visualizations.\nThrough text mining techniques and analysis of job titles, the study constructs a\ncomprehensive database of technical skills and common job roles within the IT\nindustry. Users can then input their skills and refine their profiles using visualizations\nsuch as radar charts, facilitating a personalized assessment of their strengths and\nweaknesses. The system further aids users in exploring job roles through network\nvisualizations, allowing them to visualize their placement in the IT job role space based\non their skill profiles. Overall, the C3-IoC system serves as a valuable tool for\nempowering students to make informed decisions about their career paths within the\ndynamic landscape of the IT job market.\nTheoretical Framework:\nFigure 1. C3-IoC: A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills using Machine\nLearning and Network Visualisation (José-García, A., et al. (2023). C3-IoC: Career\nGuidance System. Journal Name, 33, 1092–1119.)\nThe current C3-IoC system aims to offer personalized career exploration and facilitate users\'\nunderstanding of both technical and non-technical skills essential for IT sector careers. While\nprimarily focusing on IT, the system also includes information on various job roles to cater to\nusers outside this sector.\nThe system architecture comprises three main modules: a knowledge base of skills and job\nroles, a user skill profiling module, and a personalized job role matching and visualization\nmodule. The user journey involves three stages: initial extraction of skills through a CV parser\nand questionnaire, refinement of skill profiles, and exploration of job roles through network\nvisualization.\nThis framework emphasizes the system\'s objective of providing tailored career guidance and\nenhancing users\' comprehension of requisite skills, ensuring a comprehensive approach to\ncareer exploration within and beyond the IT domain.\nHow do you intend to solve the problem?\nTo address the educational and career planning challenges faced by senior high school\nstudents at Laguna Senior High School (LSHS), the proponent plans the development and\nimplementation of \"Career Compass,\" a personalized career guidance system powered by\nmachine learning, NLP and data analytics.\nCareer Compass aims to provide tailored assistance to students by offering a user-friendly\ninterface designed to meet their specific needs. It will incorporate informative modules covering\nvarious aspects of career planning and educational pathways, ensuring students have access to\nrelevant information.\nFurthermore, it will prioritize assessing students’ capability/knowledge per subject then\ncourse alignment as a key feature. It will offer practical tools to help students identify the best\ncollege course to take based on their interests and academic performance. Through informative\nmodules and interactive features, the system will guide students in understanding the alignment\nbetween their chosen SHS strand and potential college curricula. By integrating course\nalignment functionalities, Career Compass aims to provide students with the necessary guidance\nto make informed decisions about their educational pathways. This emphasis on course\nalignment will ensure that students are equipped with the knowledge and resources to navigate\ntheir educational and career journeys effectively. The pathway does not just stop upon college\ncourse alignment, it would also show the specifics when it comes to certain jobs/industries along\nwith up to date income range.\nIn short…\nThe criteria for alignment suggestions will be based on students’ grade per subject, interests\n(added feature), then career aspirations.\nIn return, students will receive visualizations regarding the alignment between their interests and\npotential career pathways. This includes recommendations for the best associated college\ncurricula, applicable or potential job industries, and up-to-date salary ranges for these industries.\nThey will also be able to see the relevance of their results per area and identify the exact areas\nthat lack nourishment if they have decided to pursue a certain path/job. Additionally, the system\nwill show specific areas students should navigate during their early age to help them become\nmore familiar with the background and fundamentals.\nFor example, if a student wants to be a game developer, even during their SHS, they may already\nexplore various programming languages and certain fundamentals to help them achieve their\ngoal.\nScope:\nDesign and development of a machine learning-based career guidance system aimed at\nassisting senior high school students in selecting appropriate educational and career paths\naligned with their capability in terms of their graded knowledge per subject.\nUtilization of student-based data provided by the school for training the model, complemented\nby industry data sourced from online resources to align career suggestions with current job\nmarket demands.\nImplementation of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to analyze\nstudents\' academic performance, along with job market trends, for personalized career\nrecommendations.\nIn terms of system development, a user-friendly web-based application for students and\neducational institutions, enabling easy access to personalized guidance and\nrecommendations.\nLimitations\nThe system\'s effectiveness may be limited by the availability and quality of student-based data\nprovided by the school. Insufficient or inaccurate data can impact the accuracy of career\nrecommendations.\nReliance on industry data sourced from online resources introduces the risk of outdated or\ninaccurate information. Changes in job market trends may not be promptly reflected in the\nsystem\'s recommendations.\nThe system\'s ability to generalize recommendations to diverse student profiles and career\npreferences may be a challenge. Customizing recommendations for individual students with\nunique interests and goals requires sophisticated algorithms and a comprehensive\nunderstanding of user preferences.\nHandling sensitive student data and ensuring privacy and security measures in data storage,\nprocessing, and transmission are critical concerns that need to be addressed to comply with\ndata protection regulations and maintain user trust.\nIn terms of the industry-based data, the rapidly changing nature of job markets and the\nemergence of new career paths could affect the long-term accuracy and relevance of the\nsystem\'s recommendations.\nTarget users / Beneficiaries:(Describe each Beneficiary)\nStudents:\nThe Career Compass system will be a benefit for the students by providing personalized career\nguidance and course recommendations, helping them make informed decisions about their\neducational and career pathways.\nParents:\nParents will benefit from increased confidence in their children\'s future prospects, as well as\naccess to resources based on facts and support for guiding their children through the career\nexploration process.\nSchools:\nEducational institutions can enhance student engagement and retention by integrating the Career\nCompass system into their existing platforms, providing tailored career guidance and course\nrecommendations to students based on their interests and aspirations. This implementation\nsupports more informed curriculum planning, aligning educational offerings with students\'\ncareer goals and fostering a more supportive learning environment.\nCompanies:\nEmployers will benefit from a more skilled and prepared workforce, leading to improved\nrecruitment outcomes and reduced skill gaps in the job market.\nSignificance of study:\nThe Career Compass project is significant due to its help targeted to senior high school\nstudents at Laguna Senior High School in the Philippines in terms of planning for their future\ncareers. This system uses technology to give students personalized advice on which courses to\ntake and which careers might suit them best. It\'s important as it helps students make better\nchoices about their education and future jobs. Additionally, it supports schools by providing\nthem with a helpful tool to assist their students in career planning. Ultimately, Career Compass\naims to assist students to make informed decisions and achieve success in their academic and\nprofessional lives in the long run.\nGap Analysis\nTITLE DESCRIPTION SCOPE/TECHNOLOGY YEAR\nTECHNOLOGY: C3 IoC\nC3-IoC: A Career The C3-IoC stands as a pioneering solution C3-IoC career assessment 2022\nGuidance System for in the realm of career guidance systems, system specific for the IT\nAssessing Student specifically tailored to empower students in sector.\nSkills using Machine navigating the complex landscape of the\nLearning and Information Technology (IT) sector.
